The purpose of this github is mainly to showcase that the script is save.

Its meant to recover scenarios that have been deleted by Shimmy.
We will not re-upload all these recovered scenarios, only scenarios that were created for other people's resources that were not exclusively only for Shimmy might get re-uploaded. 

The program will take a second to look through all Scenario files. It will automatically close after it worked. You can then just uninstall it again!
